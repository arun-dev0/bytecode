# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers 🐰

## The Challenge

Each new term in the **Fibonacci sequence** is generated by adding the previous two terms. 

By starting with **1** and **2**, the first 10 terms will be:

**1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...**

Notice the pattern:
- 1 + 2 = 3
- 2 + 3 = 5
- 3 + 5 = 8
- 5 + 8 = 13
- And so on...

**Your Mission:** By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed **four million**, find the sum of the **even-valued** terms.

## Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence 🌻

### What is it?
The Fibonacci sequence is one of the most famous patterns in mathematics! It appears in nature (sunflower spirals, pinecones, rabbit populations) and art.

### The Rule:
Start with 1 and 2, then each new number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

### Let's see which ones are even:
- 1 (odd)
- 2 (**even**) ✓
- 3 (odd)
- 5 (odd)
- 8 (**even**) ✓
- 13 (odd)
- 21 (odd)
- 34 (**even**) ✓
- 55 (odd)
- 89 (odd)

Do you see a pattern with the even numbers? 🤔

## Your Task 📝

1. **Generate Fibonacci numbers** up to 4,000,000
2. **Identify which ones are even**
3. **Add up all the even ones**
4. **Explain your algorithm** (see section below)

## Explaining Your Algorithm 💡

### Questions to Guide You:

1. **How will you generate the Fibonacci sequence?**
   - What are your starting numbers?
   - How do you calculate the next number?
   - When do you stop?

2. **How will you check if a number is even?**
   - Hint: Think about the modulo operator (%)

3. **How will you keep track of the sum?**
   - Do you need to store all the numbers, or just some?

4. **Can you find a pattern to make it faster?**
   - Look at the even numbers: 2, 8, 34... is there a pattern?

### Write Your Algorithm Here:

```
Step 1: 

Step 2: 

Step 3: 

Step 4:

(Add more steps as needed!)
```

### Example Algorithm Structure:
```
Step 1: Start with the first two Fibonacci numbers: 1 and 2
Step 2: Set a sum variable to 0
Step 3: While the current Fibonacci number is less than 4,000,000:
    a) Check if it's even
    b) If even, add it to the sum
    c) Generate the next Fibonacci number
Step 4: Return the sum
```

## Hints and Tips 💭

### Beginner Hints:
- You don't need to store ALL Fibonacci numbers! You only need the last two to calculate the next one
- Use variables like `previous`, `current`, and `next` to keep track
- The **modulo operator (%)** can check if a number is even: `if number % 2 == 0`

### Efficiency Hint:
- Notice that the even numbers appear in a pattern!
- Look: 2, 8, 34, 144, 610...
- Can you find the relationship? (Check: what's 2×4 + 0? What's 8×4 + 2?)

### Pattern Discovery Challenge:
Did you notice that every **3rd** Fibonacci number is even? Why is this?
- Odd + Odd = Even ✓
- Odd + Even = Odd
- Even + Odd = Odd
- Then it repeats!

If every 3rd number is even, could you skip calculating the odd ones entirely?

## Testing Your Code 🧪

Start with smaller limits to make sure your code works:

| Limit | Even Fibonacci Numbers | Expected Sum | Your Result |
|-------|------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Below 10 | 2, 8 | 10 | ? |
| Below 100 | 2, 8, 34 | 44 | ? |
| Below 1,000 | 2, 8, 34, 144, 610 | 798 | ? |
| Below 4,000,000 | (many!) | ??? | ? |

## Pseudocode Templates 📋

### Template 1: Simple Loop
```
SET first = 1
SET second = 2
SET sum = 0

WHILE second < 4000000:
    IF second is even:
        ADD second to sum
    
    SET next = first + second
    SET first = second
    SET second = next

PRINT sum
```

### Template 2: Using a Pattern (Advanced)
```
SET sum = 0
SET current_even = 2

WHILE current_even < 4000000:
    ADD current_even to sum
    // Every 3rd Fibonacci is even
    // Can you figure out the pattern to jump directly to the next even number?

PRINT sum
```

## Challenge Questions 🎯

After you solve it, think about these:

1. **How many even Fibonacci numbers are there below 4 million?**

2. **What's the largest even Fibonacci number below 4 million?**

3. **Can you solve it without checking if each number is even?** (Hint: use the pattern!)

4. **What if we wanted the sum of ODD Fibonacci numbers instead?**

5. **Can you write a formula to calculate the nth Fibonacci number without loops?** (Look up "Binet's Formula"!)

## Optimization Challenge 🚀

### Basic Solution:
- Generate all Fibonacci numbers
- Check each one for evenness
- Add even ones to sum

### Intermediate Solution:
- Generate Fibonacci numbers
- Skip checking odd numbers (use the every-3rd pattern)

### Advanced Solution:
- Generate ONLY even Fibonacci numbers directly
- Hint: If E₁ and E₂ are consecutive even Fibonacci numbers, then E₃ = 4×E₂ + E₁

Try all three approaches and compare their speed!

## Reflection Questions 🤔

1. **Did you find the pattern with even numbers?**
2. **How efficient is your solution?**
3. **Could you explain the Fibonacci sequence to a friend?**
4. **What real-world applications can you think of for this sequence?**

## Good Luck! 🌟

Remember: Understanding the pattern is more important than just getting the answer. The Fibonacci sequence is everywhere in nature and mathematics!

**Have fun exploring this beautiful pattern!** 🎉

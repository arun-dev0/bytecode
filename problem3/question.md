# Project Euler Problem 5: Smallest Multiple 🔢

## The Challenge

**2520** is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from **1 to 10** without any remainder.

Let's verify this:
- 2520 ÷ 1 = 2520 ✓
- 2520 ÷ 2 = 1260 ✓
- 2520 ÷ 3 = 840 ✓
- 2520 ÷ 4 = 630 ✓
- 2520 ÷ 5 = 504 ✓
- 2520 ÷ 6 = 420 ✓
- 2520 ÷ 7 = 360 ✓
- 2520 ÷ 8 = 315 ✓
- 2520 ÷ 9 = 280 ✓
- 2520 ÷ 10 = 252 ✓

**Your Mission:** What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from **1 to 20**?

## Understanding the Problem 🤔

### What does "evenly divisible" mean?
A number is evenly divisible by another if there's no remainder when you divide them.
- 12 is evenly divisible by 3 (12 ÷ 3 = 4, remainder 0) ✓
- 13 is NOT evenly divisible by 3 (13 ÷ 3 = 4, remainder 1) ✗

### What are we looking for?
We need the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of all numbers from 1 to 20!

The LCM is the smallest number that ALL of these numbers divide into evenly.

### Important Insight 💡
You DON'T need to check every single number from 1 upward. There's a much smarter way!

## Your Task 📝

1. **Understand what LCM means**
2. **Think about which numbers actually matter**
3. **Write an algorithm** to find the LCM
4. **Optimize your approach** (brute force will take forever!)

## Explaining Your Algorithm 💡

### Questions to Guide You:

1. **The Brute Force Way** (not recommended!)
   - Start at 20 and check if it's divisible by all numbers 1-20
   - If not, try 21, 22, 23...
   - Why is this a bad idea? How long would it take?

2. **Which numbers can we ignore?**
   - Do we really need to check divisibility by 1?
   - If a number is divisible by 20, is it also divisible by 10? By 5? By 4?
   - Can we eliminate some numbers from our checks?

3. **What about prime factorization?**
   - Every number can be broken down into prime factors
   - Example: 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 (or 2² × 3)
   - How can this help us?

4. **What is LCM and how do we calculate it?**
   - LCM is related to GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
   - Formula: LCM(a, b) = (a × b) / GCD(a, b)
   - How can we use this for multiple numbers?

## Hints and Tips 💭

### Beginner Approach: Eliminate Unnecessary Checks
Think about what numbers you actually need to test:
- If divisible by 20, automatically divisible by 10, 5, 4, 2, 1
- If divisible by 18, automatically divisible by 9, 6, 3
- If divisible by 16, automatically divisible by 8, 4, 2
- If divisible by 14, automatically divisible by 7, 2

**Challenge:** Can you figure out the minimal set of numbers to check?

### Intermediate Approach: Use LCM
The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of multiple numbers can be calculated step by step:
- Start with LCM = 1
- For each number from 2 to 20:
  - Calculate: LCM = (LCM × number) / GCD(LCM, number)

You'll need to implement GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) first!

### Advanced Approach: Prime Factorization
This is the SMARTEST approach:

1. **Find all primes up to 20:** 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19

2. **For each prime, find the highest power needed:**
   - 2: What's the highest power of 2 in 1-20? It's 16 = 2⁴
   - 3: What's the highest power of 3 in 1-20? It's 9 = 3²
   - 5: What's the highest power of 5 in 1-20? It's 5¹
   - And so on...

3. **Multiply them all together:**
   - Answer = 2⁴ × 3² × 5¹ × 7¹ × 11¹ × 13¹ × 17¹ × 19¹

**This runs instantly!** ⚡

## Testing Your Code 🧪

Test with smaller ranges first:

| Range | Smallest Multiple | Your Result |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 to 5 | 60 | ? |
| 1 to 7 | 420 | ? |
| 1 to 10 | 2520 | ? |
| 1 to 13 | 360360 | ? |
| 1 to 20 | ??? | ? |

## Pseudocode Templates 📋

### Template 1: Brute Force (SLOW - for learning only!)
```
SET number = 20

WHILE true:
    SET divisible = true
    
    FOR each divisor from 1 to 20:
        IF number % divisor != 0:
            SET divisible = false
            BREAK
    
    IF divisible:
        RETURN number
    
    INCREMENT number by 1
```
⚠️ **Warning:** This will take a VERY long time for 1-20!

### Template 2: Using LCM (EFFICIENT)
```
FUNCTION gcd(a, b):
    WHILE b != 0:
        temp = b
        b = a % b
        a = temp
    RETURN a

FUNCTION lcm(a, b):
    RETURN (a * b) / gcd(a, b)

SET result = 1
FOR number from 2 to 20:
    result = lcm(result, number)

PRINT result
```

### Template 3: Prime Factorization (MOST EFFICIENT)
```
FIND all primes up to 20

FOR each prime:
    FIND highest power of prime that is <= 20
    MULTIPLY result by (prime ^ power)

PRINT result
```

## Mathematical Concepts 📚

### What is GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)?
The largest number that divides both numbers evenly.
- GCD(12, 8) = 4
- GCD(15, 10) = 5

**Euclid's Algorithm** calculates GCD efficiently:
```
GCD(a, b):
    while b ≠ 0:
        temp = b
        b = a mod b
        a = temp
    return a
```

### What is LCM (Least Common Multiple)?
The smallest number that both numbers divide into evenly.
- LCM(12, 8) = 24
- LCM(15, 10) = 30

**Formula:** LCM(a, b) = (a × b) / GCD(a, b)

### Prime Factorization
Every number can be expressed as a product of prime numbers:
- 12 = 2² × 3
- 18 = 2 × 3²
- 20 = 2² × 5

To find LCM using prime factorization:
- Take the HIGHEST power of each prime that appears
- LCM(12, 18, 20) = 2² × 3² × 5 = 180
